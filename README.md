Hi! How are you? I'm a developer that loves create new things! Let's create something together? 🔨 Currently I'm learning and trying to expand my knowledge in Node.js, ReactJS and React Native 🤓📖, but I already worked with PHP for a few years. I also love animes, so soon I will try develop more things related to it.
